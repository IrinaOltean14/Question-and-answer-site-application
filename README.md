# Question-and-answer-site-application

An application that simulates a question and aswer site (e.g. Stack Overflow).

When the application is launched a new window is created for each user. The window will show a list with all the questions asked so far (a user can add a new question, add an answer and an answer given by the current user will be shown in a yellow backround).

Another window will allow any user to search for a question: as the user types, the results are being shown (the best matching question together with the top three answers).

C++, using Qt framework (for GUI)
